;; [2009.10.10] This file establishes the connection between the

;; management of the runitme, and the control module.

;; Presently, everything runs in the same process.  In the future, the
;; runtime, compiler, and control module could all be in separate
;; processes if desired.


;; TEMP: this is sloppily set as a global variable and then shared by runtime_manager.ss
