;;;; main_chez.ss
;;;; Loads the regiment compiler in Chez Scheme.

;;;; NOTE: This file uses (include ...) rather than (load ...) 
;;;; This basically inlines all the code in question into this file at compile time.
;;;; Thus, making a compiled copy of this file makes a compiled copy of the whole system.
;;;; HOWEVER: I broke this rule for things that depend on whether or not SWL is loaded.
;;;; TODO FIXME: I can also make this happen at compile time, via macros.
