================================================================================
Things I'm working on now --Ryan:

REACTIVATE THAT TEST WITHIN DESUGAR-PATTERN-MATCHING... AND FIX THE TYPE CHECKER!



================================================================================
TOOPTIMIZE:

*) Look at all uses of recover-type... this is a great source of inefficiency.


================================================================================

[2009.01.21]
 *) Inlining rators that are record-dereferences (or tuples).  It is
    quite useful to package methods together in a record.

[2008.11.11]
  *) It probably wouldn't hurt to make tupref's simple expressions.
  *) If interested we could implement polymorphic positional tuple access by 
     switching the source-level tuples into a syntactic sugar for records.
     But... could we get into trouble with the scoped labels?


[2008.11.07]

  *) It would be nice to expose wsfifo, refcounting, and free
     operations in the intermediate language.  Then some of the work
     could be lifted off emit-c2 and into an earlier pass (such as
     building free_ functions for each type).

[2008.10.02]
  *) partition-graph-by-namespace still only does a shallow scan.  It needs to do the transitive closure.

[2008.08.26]
  *) verify-elaborated looks very rotted, it needs to be overhauled.

[2008.08.04]
  *) Working on marshal/unmarshel, eventually, readFile codegen should leverage unmarshal.

[2008.07.22] 
  *) Consolidate array-freeing cases in emit-c2.  All arrays of
     scalars can be handled uniformly.

[2008.07.01] {Expand backend intermediate language}
  *) Eventually I would like to expand the IL just towards the end of
   the compiler to handle things like multiple input paths and output
   paths so that we have the language to express the result of
   union-iterate-route optimzations.  This will complicate code
   generation but hopefully happen right at the end.

[2008.05.28] {wsc2 additions for running on phones}
  *) I need to get the foreign interface going if I'm going to
     integrate with sensor hardware on phones.


[2008.02.29] {Benchmarks to implement}
  *) Elizabeth should be looking at StreamSQL benchmarks.
     I'd like to do some simple "Pig Latin" style benchmarks.

[2008.02.15]

  *) Modify lift-immutable-constants to eliminate duplicates.
  *) Statically allocate arrays as well as strings.
  *) Allow emit-static-array as idiom for communication.
  *) Support sensors, radio

[2008.01.25]
  *) Should do some renaming:
     wsc     -> wscpp.old
     wsc.new -> wscpp.corefit
     wsc2    -> 
   How do I configure either wscpp for 


[2007.12.27] 
  *) Need to switch regression over to wsc.new, and start including wsc2


[2007.12.20] {Doing the right thing for wsparse}

  X) The wsparse "server" solution is really quite silly.  What I should do
is just have a command line version (like plain "wsparse") that is
called once, and kept open.  You pay the startup cost only once,
irrespective of how many files you parse.  So it's almost as good as
the server without the fragilities.

  *) Add monomorphic first-order functions to the backends.
     Gotta work with Michael to get merging going right.


[2007.12.07]
  *) I *really* need to optimize large arrays at interpret-meta time.


[2007.10.22] {Sharing in Stream DAG}
   *) It's been clear for a while now that the stream DAG notation
      should be able to capture repeated identical operators.  This
      should probably be implemented in interpret-meta.
      Interpret-meta should hash the stream kernels that it generates
      (or the inputs that generate them), so that it knows when it can
      use the same kernel function in two operators.  This will also
      require widening the output grammar to accept names rather than
      lambda expressions as argument to an "iterate" (how else to
      express the sharing?). 

[2007.10.20] {Critical path for PLDI}
What's the critical path for the remaining weeks before PLDI?
 *) For data-rep transforms:
   ~) Empirically measure data rep effiiency across backends.
   *) Implement IFPROFILE switch (though could maybe do without).
   X) Implement "coerce" in its basic, inefficient form.
     X) That means having some way of expressing mappings from T1 => T2
   *) Implement "push-through" that pushes a transform into an
      upstream or downstream operator.
   *) Implement accessor short-circuiting optimizations (build(i,f)[j] => f(j))
      And map/tabulate fold/tabulate deforestations.
   *) Array/Array: Speed up a naive matrix library?

 X) For rewrite opts:
   X) Make interpret-meta idempotent.
   X) Tag "special" stream prim names.  Pull out their defs in the initial program.
   X) After interpret-meta, we want to inline single-ref variables (in
      object and meta-code) to get a squished-together expression that we an
      match our patterns against.  This is probably better than trying
      to "see through" variable bindings when looking for applications of a
      rewrite rule.  (Reference counting becomes annoying, and the inliner
      needs to be sucked into the rewrite pass.)
   X) Apply rewrite rules to special prims.
   X) Push their defs back in after the first interpret-meta.

 *) For stream-graph parallelism opts:
   ~) Identify "maps"... general stateless operators are annoying to deal with.
   ~) Take heavy maps and split them N ways, insert splitter&joiner.
   ~) Insert rewindow/dewindow around busy edges.
   X) Merge operators.
   That's as far as we'll go at first.

 *) For profiling (waiting on Michael's stuff):
    This is what will drive the control policies of the other opts.
   *) Profile times as well as data rate.  Profile data sizes.

[2007.09.20]
 *) Change regiment-primitive? to use symbol props.
 *) Is -exit-error not working for type errors?

[2007.09.16] {MLton integer constants}
 *) Fix emit-mlton to ascribe types to integer constants, even if
    mlton-ascribe-types is turned off.
 *) Also refactor mlton-ascribe-types so that it doesn't touch the shared module.

[2007.09.14] {Ideas that haven't been written up}
Here are some things we've worked on in this project that haven't been written up yet:
 *) interpret-meta
 *)

[2007.07.28]
 *) When not in debug mode, DEBUASSERT should not evaluate the val
    even when called (DEBUGASSERT pred val).  I think I initially
    conceived of that as a way to optionally assert a predicate on a
    value before returning it.  However, now I very frequently use
    that form of invocation just to get the better error message when the
    assertion fails.

[2007.07.27]
 *) I'm pretty confident that I can add a -fastprune option that would
    eliminated dead code very early (without type checking it!).
    While dangerous, I think this would be useful.  Perhaps it could
    be restricted a little to only prune official "standard library" code...

[2007.07.07]
 Need to use two threads and add a buffer for wsmlton's ensbox data acquisition.
 Also, can remove one copy of the data relative to how I do things right now.

[2007.07.03]
 *) Add Int64 to support proper timestamps in sigsegs.
 *) Need a binary file sink too..
 *) MLton FFI & ensbox data acquisition.

[2007.06.28]
    Add ws.early for running queries *without* running static elaborate.

[2007.05.29]
  *) Eventually reduce dependency on C++ features in wsc.
     In particular... tuples should not have constructors.

[2007.05.17]

  *) Need to make "using Matrix:Float;" work.

[2007.03.24]
  *) Because all these backends are a mess... it would be nice if the
     polymorphic printing were implemented in the language (in the
     compiler, at least).  We could generate abstract syntax for the
     printer functions in the compiler, then it wouldn't have to be
     implemented separately for each backend.

[2007.03.19]
  *) Oops, Array and Hashtable need to be treated like Ref too.

[2007.03.17]
  X) Add REF types!!!
  *) Wouldn't hurt to have haskell-style "sections"

[2007.03.13]
  *) Make dependencies on GSL and fftw non-static.

[2007.03.13]
  *) Check the prims handled by emit-c against the prim_defs list.

[2007.03.11]
  X) Revisit type aliases at some point.

[2007.03.09]
  *) It would be nice to make a manual "fuse-passes" function that
     fuses two passes defined with "define-pass".  This would be
     tricky and will probably just work for passes that return a single
     expression value as their intermediate form from the Expr function.

[2007.03.09] {Optimization todo-list}
These are the order that optimizations need to be implemented: 
  *) Copy-propogation
  *) De-boosting, manually managed memory for arrays especially
  *) (Non-optimization) replace stl vectors with plain C-arrays


[2007.03.08]
  *) I think I can make a good foreign interface that would allow
     pulling in all the GSL functions easily.

[2007.03.07]
 X) What happened to my work on that little syntax to bind projectors
    for a tuple-stream?

[2007.03.05]
 X) allow type assertions on state var declarations
 *) add += *=... couldn't hurt.

[2007.03.04]
 *) use boost shared_array rather than a shared_ptr to a Vector
 
[2007.03.02]
 *) uniform value printing
 *) remove dependence on $WAVESCOPED/Makefile in wsc process.

[2007.02]

Severe problems that need to be fixed::

FIXME:
  The type checker bug regarding petite chez.
  Look at tests in system_tests and hm_type_inference.ss, they explain
  the problem.


[2007.02.11]
 *) Initialize class-typed iterator state properly (not from within
    the {} of the constructor)

 *) How about ditching the current elaborator and putting a
    straightforward interpreter in its place.  It would evaluate
    lazily, and treat streams and streams as *values*.  It
    would make a single pass through the program.

[2007.02.07]
 X) Remove distributed Regiment primitives from wavescope compiles.
 ~~) Add general binary reader!
 *) Don't forget my syntax for binding stream-projectors.

[2007.01.27]

 X) Build .boot file.
 *) Finish implementing equality
 *) Make printed representations consistent between WS and WSC. 
 X) Push generic arith system to the front end.
 X) add ws.opt and wsc.opt targets for when performance is critical.

[2006.11.29]
 X) For distribution compile a separate regiment.opt for simulations.
    (The default checkout should be opt-level 2, DEBUG on.)

[2006.11.08]
 *) Move more into the simworld structure.  In particular, world
    xbound/ybound.  Maybe connectivity model also.

[2006.11.05]
 *) Change inliner to allow "lib" functions that don't inline (of
    appropriate type). [Did a weird hack for this instead.]

[2006.11.01]
  Should include optional Intermediate? check for define-pass to
verify that a user function produces a valid intermediate record.
It's very easy to accidentally return an expression where you were
supposed to return an intermediate record.

[2006.10.17~]

 *) Completing static-elaboration for effectful constructs
 ~~) Inserting grammars between passes. [Significant progress]
 ~~) Moving to generic-traversal for early passes. [2006.10]
 *) Fixing let, letrec, lazy-letrec.
    *) Make "let" not desugar... (for consistency with typing rules)
    *) Make letrec strict throughout the compiler.
 *) Would like to get the LAML Schemedoc stuff working again.

 ~~) Add matrix WS operations
   *) Also add more FFT ops (maybe stream-lifted version too) 


[2006.09.03]
  X) Do not desugar one-armed if in the parser!!!

[2006.09.01]
 *) I have NEVER taken advantage of the "test-this" convention, I should do away with it.

[2006.08.29]

 x) How much work would it be to track source locations?
  [2006.12.03]
  So what I would like to do is add a general association list of "info" to each term.
  This is analogous to the to a parameterized "expr 'a" type in ML.
  THEN I can remove certain hackish things.


[2006.08.02]

 x) Encapsulate thread related things into a threads.ss
 *) Is there any way to get "languages" working in PLT?
 X) Finish porting modules to common module format.

[2006.05.02]

 -) Unit tests for deglobalize2


[2006.04.03]

  -) Add type checking to TMs.
  X) Add type checking between all passes of the compiler.
  X) Add more custom grammar checks.
  X) (Maybe fix the system for grammar check errors, it's fundamentally
     broken and a hack.)
  X) Rework type system.
  X) Add and use generic traverse for Regiment as well as TML.
  x) Lift out certain Regiment utilities from individual passes into common files.



================================================================================
COMPLETELY FINISHED:

<Done> [2005.10.19] Make the chez version use records.  Better safety that way.
Can't remember why I didn't originally.
<Done> [2006.10] Reorganizing files into a deeper hierarchy. [2006.10.17]

 X) I am going to need to add a pass to annotate the type of rators.
    Will need this to make the elaborator work right.

 X) Bringing PLT version back online.
   *) Move chez/alpha_lib to generic

 X) Porting over to common module system.

 X) sigseg_foreach (but no efficient support yet)

 X) Inserting type-checking between passes.
   ~) De-primitive-izing tuple, tupref [2006.10]

 X) Updating type checker to handle partially annotated programs.

[2007.08.13] {Deployment}

 *) check out degap
 

[2007.08.14]

Run AML on the nodes.
Make cluster algorithm use detection time.

[2007.09.07]

Came across serious incompleteness in treatment of Sum types.  After
metaprogram evaluation we need to switch to having explicit sums (not
named sum-types), or we need to split the datatype decls
appropriately, because they *may not be used polymorphically* after
that point.  This new pass could be similar to nominalize-types...
.
Right now, if you try to instantiate the same data
constructor with different types in different parts of the program, it
will break!
