[2008.07.21]

This directory is somewhat confusing because it contains auxillary
files for multiple backends.  Roughly, the filse can be identified by
extension:

 *.nc         -- TinyOS files for wstiny
 *.cpp, *.hpp -- files for wsc
 *.c, *.h     -- files for wsc2
 *.java       -- files for wsjava
 *.tm         -- token machine files for old regiment backend
