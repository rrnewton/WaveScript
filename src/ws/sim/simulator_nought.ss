;; REQUIRES EQUAL? BASED HASH TABLES!!!


;; simulator_nought.ss
;;  -Ryan Newton [2004.05]
;===============================================================================

;; This is a simulator for the output of pass10_deglobalize.  

;; This file uses and abuses top-level bindings (like mad), because it
;; uses eval, so it's not very well encapsulated right now.

;; NOTE: Unlike some of the files in the chez directory, this expects
;; to be loaded from its own parent directory.

;; NOTE: Assumes that "simulator_nought.examples.ss" has been loaded.

;; <TODO>: Make the simulator not use global state for the graph!!

;=============================================================
;; REQUIRES: This file requires that the slib 'tsort module be loaded
;; providing the topological-sort function.

;; REQUIRES: Also on hash tables from SLIB.

;; REQUIRES: This file requires the "flat_threads.ss" interface, which
;; is a simple interface over engines or threads.

;===============================================================================

;; TYPE SIGNATURES:

;; Simulator = Simulation, ?timeout -> ReturnVals
;; Simulation = soc-return, soc-finish -> (vector socthunk [nodethunks])


;; compile-simulate-nought :: tokmachineprog -> [socprog, nodeprog]

;; build-simulation :: [socprog, nodeprog] -> Simulation

;; generate-simulator :: threadrunner, simcore ->
;;                       thesim, ?timeout -> 
;;                       returnvals
;;    threadrunner :: Thunks, ?TimeOut -> (All_Threads_Returned | Threads_Timed_Out)
;;    simcore :: ThunksVec ->? Timeout -> ThunksList




;===============================================================================
;; Some CHANGES (not keeping a complete log):

;; [2005.03.01] This simulator has become pretty disgusting.  It
;; should not have the complexity of gradient/flood etc built into it.
;; Right now it is both complex, and not providing the functionality
;; it should (good radio model, etc).  I'm working on a much more simple simulator_alpha.

;; [2004.07.27] Adding return timer.

;; Ok, I was going to add a time-window for the return values, but
;; right now I'm deciding between that and an explicit generation
;; counter.  But how would I know whether I've gotten everything in
;; the generation?  Could use a safely large time-window and seperate
;; out the different generations within it?
;;   Well, either way, I'm adding a timer now.

;; [2004.07.11] Fixing soc-return and soc-finish.
;; Doing a refactoring to depend less on my mutation of the global
;; environment.  I've been really sloppy in this because I thought it
;; would be such a "quick and easy" little simulator.  Now the
;; simulation object returned by build-simulation takes and passes on
;; soc-return and soc-finish functions.  The node-prog and soc-progs
;; have been modified accordingly.

;; [2004.06.28]
;; Added a special under-the-table "return" message.  It is handled
;; seperately from other messages.  This message must have six arguments:
;; msg-object:  timestamp, origin, parent, count, ARGS
;; ARGS: return_val  -- the value being returned
;;       to_tok      -- the token to which the value shall be passed when it gets home
;;       via_tok     -- the token supplying the back-trail for the return to follow
;;       seed_val    -- the base-value for the binary-op 
;;       aggr_tok    -- the token (binary function) for aggregating this return
;;       senders     -- this is temporary, it keeps a list of all nodes contributing 
;;                      to the current aggregated result

;; NOT FINISHED:

;; [2004.06.09] (soc-return v) Will make v *one of* the return values (a
;; whole stream of them can be provided). (soc-finished) will terminate
;; the computation if there has been a returned value, 
;; ???? WHAT IF ITS NOT SOC CALLING? ????

;;otherwise it
;; will just terminate the thread for the processor

;;[2004.06.09] RRN: Adding implicit 'I-am-SOC' boolean variable for
;; use by node programs.. This is only used by generated code, or my
;; handwritten test cases.  Along with it is a SOC-processor binding
;; which is bound to the simobject for the SOC.


;===============================================================================
;; GLOBAL VARIABLES AND TYPES:


; This one prints nothing at all:
;(define-syntax DEBUGPRINT (syntax-rules () [(_ expr ...) (begin expr ...)]))
(define-syntax DEBUGPRINT (syntax-rules () [(_ expr ...) (void)]))
; This is a SECOND print channel for even lamer information:
(define-syntax DEBUGPRINT2 (syntax-rules () [(_ expr ...) (void)]))            ; ON
;(define-syntax DEBUGPRINT2 (syntax-rules () [(_ expr ...) (begin expr ...)]))  ; OFF



;; The main global variables are graph, object-graph, and all-objs

;; NOTE!  The simulator dynamically defines top level variables:
;;  total-messages, soc-return, soc-finished, stop-nodes

;; This is the simplest simulator ever.  Takes the output of pass "deglobalize".
(define this-unit-description 
  "simulator_nought.ss: simplest simulator for nodal language")

;; This is our logger for events in the simulator:
(define (logger ob . args)
  (if (simulation-logger)
      (if (null? args)
	  (critical-section
	   (begin (display ob (simulation-logger))
		  (newline (simulation-logger))))

  (syntax-rules ()
      [(_ exp ...)
      (if (simulation-logger)
	  (parameterize ([current-output-port (simulation-logger)])
			exp ...))]))

;; This makes it use a lame sort of text display instead of the graphics display:
(define-wavescript-parameter simulator-output-text #f (lambda (x) x))
;; This is a SEPERATE LOGGER for debug info as opposed to simulation events.
(define-wavescript-parameter sim-debug-logger 
  (lambda args

     (apply printf args)))
  (lambda (x)

;; Incoming is a list of messages (or return-objs).
;; Redraw is a boolean indicating whether the object needs be redrawn.
;; [2004.06.11] Added homepage just for my internal hackery.
;; [2004.06.13] Be careful to change "cleanse-world" if you change
;; this, we don't want multiple simulation to be thrashing eachother.
;; [2004.07.08] I don't know why I didn't do this, but I'm storing the

;; This record holds the info that the token cache needs to maintain
;; per each token name.
;; NOTE: The lack of a *parent* indicates that the message is a local call:

			      origin ;; :: simobject - original source of message
			      parent ;; :: simobject - who I got it from
			      count
			      args))

;; [2004.07.27]
;; Doing a refactoring to add this, seperating msg-object's from return-objs
(reg:define-struct 
  (return-obj
   ;; has some analogous fields to msg-object:
   timestamps parent counts
   ;; And other fields for the purpose of propogating return values.
