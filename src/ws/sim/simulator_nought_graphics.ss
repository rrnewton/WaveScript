;; This depends on simulator_nought.ss and runs a similar simulation
;; but with a graphical interface.  This file might also depend on all
;; the resources that simulator_nought.ss depends on.

;; REQUIRES: This file requires the "graphics_stub.ss" interface be loaded
;; so that it may draw the simulation upon the screen.
