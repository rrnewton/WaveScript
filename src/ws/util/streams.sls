;;; Stream functions.
;;;
;;; [2004.06.17] These functions deal with streams that are represented
;;; as a list, promise, or improper list with a promise as its final
;;; cdr-pointer.  That is:                         <br><br>
;;;  Stream  := (item*)                            <br>
;;;           | (item* . promise)                  <br>
;;;           | promise                            <br><br>
;;;
;;; [2005.10.16] Just switched this from head-strict to not.
;;; I should probably switch over to using the standard SRFI-40 stream
;;; implementation at some point. <br><br>
;;;
;;; [2006.02.19] NOTE: Streams are not currently an ADT. Their
;;; representation is transparent.  The user is free to construct
;;; their own tail-delayed lists with whatever strictness pattern
;;; they wish.
