;;;; .title source_loader.ss 

;;;; [2005.11.11] This library loads  from a ".rs" file
;;;; and desugars it according to a few simple conventions that I've
;;;; followed.  It can also load token machine ".tm" files.

; [2006.02.27] Refactored to use new common module syntax.

; [2006.10.25] This now contains some of the code to parse&load ".ws" files as well.
; Note, .rs files have a mechanism for including simulator parameter settings in the file.
; .ws files have nothing comparable at the moment.
