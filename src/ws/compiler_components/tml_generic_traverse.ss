;;;; .title Generic Tree Walker for TML (tml_generic_traverse.ss)

;;;; This is used by several passes which operate on TML (Token Machine
;;;; Language) code.  It enables very easy traversal of TML code, for
;;;; when you only need to match against and change a single case, and
;;;; you want to avoid writing the "boilerplate" code that traverses the
;;;; other cases.
;;;; <br><br>

;;;; It could be used by all the passes; they all do tree-walks.  And I
;;;; may write more passes to use it.  But it's best for cases when you
;;;; only touch a small fraction of the grammar's variants.
;;;; <br><br>

;;;; WIDE GRAMMAR: Currently, this is used in multiple passes
;;;; (desugar-let-stored, desugare-soc-return, cps-tokmac,
;;;; convert-closure, but it could be more).  As such, it basically
;;;; supports the union of the grammars.  This hopefully will not cause
;;;; bugs for us, because they are distinct forms that can't be confused
;;;; with one another.  But watch out.
;;;; <br><br>

;;;; As we use this for more passes we'll widen the grammar further.
;;;; <br><br>

;;;; [2005.10.02] Just factored this out into this file. <br>

;;;; [2006.01.12] Adding support for dynamically targetted ext-ref and ext-set! <br>
