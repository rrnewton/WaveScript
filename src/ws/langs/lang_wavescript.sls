;; [2006.07.22]

;; This language definition implements WaveScript, with its Sigsegs and all.
;; Uses the stream-processing API defined elsewhere.

;; TODO: Make the core language bindings into a module which is
;; imported when eval happens.  This way even petite with a limited
;; heap will still get performance.

;; This has become *terribly* non-portable.
