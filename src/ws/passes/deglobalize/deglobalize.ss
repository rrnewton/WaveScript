 ;;;; TODO: Make it so that returning a distributed value actually
;;;; collects and returns all the values therein, rather than just
;;;; returning the corresponding membership token.


;; INCOMPLETE: this doesn't actually use the CFG right now.

;;;; Pass 20: deglobalize
;;;; April 2004
;===============================================================================

;;;; This pass represents the biggest jump in the compiler.  It
;;;; transforms my simplified global language into a local program to
;;;; be run in each node in the sensor network.

;;;; We introduce a simple imperative language for the token-handlers
;;;; within each node programs.  In this case, it's naturally a subset
;;;; of scheme, but it gets reduced further in the next pass 
;;;; (cleanup-token-machine).

;; NOTE: To add code for a new primitive, the most important things to do are
;; to add an entry to explode-primitive and to primitive-return.


;;;; Input grammar:

;;;; <Pgm>  ::= <Let>
;;;; <Let>  ::= (lazy-letrec ([<Var> <Type> <Exp>]*) <Var>)
;;;; <Exp>  ::= <Simple>
;;;;          | (if <Simple> <Simple> <Simple>)
;;;;          | (lambda (<Var>*) (<Type>*) <Let>)
;;;;          | (<primitive> <Simple>*)
;;;; <Simple> ::= (quote <Lit>) | <Var>


;;;; Output grammar = Input grammar to cleanup-token-machine = messy

;;;;<br><br> [2006.03.15] 
;;;;
;;;;  Each "edge" in the query circuit, that is, each name bound in
;;;;  the program, will either have a "distributed" (monadic) or a
;;;;  "local" type.  Currently, each distributed name has
;;;;  corresponding membership/formation names.  It's operational
;;;;  realization will be some firing of membership tokens by that
;;;;  name. 
;;;;
;;;;  This is tricky with nested regions.  The type has two occurences
;;;;  of "Region" in it, but the compiler can only give one name to
;;;;  the thing (there would be no way to statically know how many
;;;;  names to give it).  This is where token indices come in.  The
;;;;  code generator here in deglobalize must cleverly index the
;;;;  membership and formation tokens so as to not allow undesirable
;;;;  collisions.

;===============================================================================
;; Some CHANGES (not keeping a complete log):

;;[2004.06.09] RRN: Adding a 'soc-return' form.  Anything

;;[2004.06.09] RRN: Adding implicit 'I-am-SOC' boolean variable for
;; use by node programs.. This is only for generated code, or my
;; handwritten test cases.

;; [2004.06.13] RRN: Moved functions for dealing with token names into helpers.ss


;=========================================
;; EXAMPLE:

;; This program just returns 3.  It has a generic binding defining a
;; single constant, it has no startup tokens (startups must be
;; *tokens* not other bindings.)  It has no socpgm-exclusive bindings,
;; and the socprogram merely returns the single value, then finishes.
