;;;; Pass: Reify Certain Types
;;;; This pass passes types as explicit arguments to those primitives that need them.

;; [2007.07.05] Adapting this for use by ws.early.  It needs to accept
;; pre-static elaborate input.  Thus it must be versatile enough to be
;; called near the front or near the end of the compiler.

;; Note!  This requires stripping out src-pos info, as it breaks some
;; of the pattern matching below.
