;;;; .title Remove Lazy Letrec

;;;; [2006.11.16]

;;;; This is relatively nasty hack.  We reorder a lazy-letrec's
;;;; bindings to respect its dependencies.  Thereafter it can be
;;;; implemented with letrecs.  This disallows mutual recursion.
;;;; (or currently with LET, which disallows all recursion)

;;;; Since this *is* a hack, it doesn't really implement *lazy*
;;;; letrec.  It would have to thunk everything.
