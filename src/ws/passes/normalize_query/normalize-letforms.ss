;;;; .title Pass: Normalize Let-forms
;;;; .author Ryan Newton

;;;; This pass tries to inject a little sanity into what is going on with lets.

;;;;   It ensures that letrecs only bind functions.
;;;;   It tries to give a semi-reasonable translation of lazy-letrec.
;;;;   It reintroduces let*.


;; Assumes variable names are unique.
