;; deal with numeric constants.  The problem is that we don't yet know
;; what type we're dealing with (int, int16, int64).  And we can't
;; tell from the value's representation.  So I hackishly inserted some
;; "gints", all integer metavalues become gints...
;;
;; This should be *ok* because the program already passed the more
;; conservative type checking before getting here.  Besides, we should
;; eventually make all integer constants "gint".
